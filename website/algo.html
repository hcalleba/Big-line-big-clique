      <h4>Adding new vertex</h4>
      <p>
        Each time a new vertex is inserted (clicked on the canvas) a loop will go over all the vertices in the graph to make sure it is not a duplicate vertex. O(n)
      </p>
      <h4>Collinearity</h4>
      <p>
        There are multiple ways to do this. The first way would be for each vertex calculate the slope to every other vertex and look for duplicates. These can be found by sorting the slopes and comparing them to adjacent values. This would be in O(n<sup>2</sup>*log(n)). Instead we will use a hashmap to find duplicates. This will give us a complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>).
      </p>
      <h4>Visibility graph</h4>
      <p>
        This looks very familiar to the algorithm for colinearity. Actually both parts could have easily be grouped together as both algorithm do the same calculations and insert approximately the same values in the hashmap. This would have been faster, but for more readability and because these calculations are not the bottleneck of the computations, the two parts have been separated. Here again a hashmap of the slopes will be created for each vertex. The  difference  with the previous map is that for a vertex i, the slope for all vertices will be computed and put into the hashmap instead of only the vertices with an index > i as previously. Once this hashmap is completed for a certain vertex, his closest left and right (above and below if slope is infinity) neighbors for each slope will be computed and put into his list of neighbors. So as a recap, for a vertex v, every other vertex will be added to his neighbors unless there is another closer neighbor with the same slope on the same side of v. This is thus a visibility graph. The complexity is again O(n<sup>2</sup>) because we have two nested for loops looping over every vertex. It is although much slower than the collinearity algorithm because the amount of computations of the second loop is always n while for collinearity it is n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1, 0.
      </p>
      <h4>Maximum clique</h4>
      <p>
        First let's point out that we will not only find tha maximum clique's size but also the maximum clique itself for this algorithm. The size can obviously be found with size of the clique we will find. The used algorithm is the one from Carraghan & Pardalos (1990) and is reffered as CP algorithm. The CP algorithm uses two key vertex sets: C (called current solution or clique) and P (called candidate vertex set or candidate set). C designates the clique under construction while P is a subset of vertices of the graph (not in C) such that every vertex of P is connected to every vertex of C. Thus the name "candidate set" as every vertex of P can be added to the clique in construction to create a bigger clique.
      </p>
      <p>
        The algorithm operates by calling recursively the function Clique(C,P) starting with an emty clique C = &empty; and P = "every vertex of the graph". We will use a global variable C_max to maintain the largest clique discovered so far. Let N(v) be the set of vertices adjacent to vertex v, here is the pseudocode of the algoritm:
      </p>
      <pre>
        1.  C_max = &empty; // The maximum clique
        2.  Function Clique(set C, set P)
        3.     if (|C| > |C_max|) :
        4.       C_max = C
        5.     if (|C| + |P| > |C_max|) :
        6.       for all p &in; P :
        7.         P = P \ {p}
        8.         C' = C &cup; {p}
        9.         P' = P &cap; N(p)
        10.        Clique(C', P')
      </pre>
      <p>
        It is then called with <code>Clique(&empty;, V)</code> (V = v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, ..., v<sub>n</sub> being all the vertices of the graph). We first start with ean empty set C and P equal to V. Then we try to find all cliques bigger than the size of our current maximal clique with v<sub>1</sub> in it. And we continue to do so for v<sub>2</sub> but without v<sub>1</sub> etc. until v<sub>n</sub>. The key part of this algorithm is the pruning strategy at line 5. We test if the maximal size of the clique we are currently building can surpass the size of our maximal clique in the case we added all the vertices of P to C. If not there is no point in continuiong exploring this clique as it will never be better than the one we already found. If there was no pruning, then we would just go over all the cliques of the graph.
      </p>
      <p>
        For line 9, we have to compute the union of two sets of vertices. This problem is again similar to the collinear points/visibility graph algorithm. We could to a simple search over every value from both sets and have a O(n) complexity. Or we could first sort the sets (we can actually only sort one) and then compare them with a total complexity of O(nlog(n)). Or we could hash one set and search for occurences of the second one for a total complexity of O(n).
      </p>
      <p>
        The performance of this algorithm highly depend on the ordering the vertices, v<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>2</sub>,â€¦,v<sub>n</sub>. Here we have chosen to sort vertices by degree, v<sub>1</sub> having th esmallest degree.
      </p>
      <h4>Chromatic number</h4>
      <p>
        This problem is again NP-complete and thus very hard to compute efficiently. Here we will not compute the chromatic number from scratch but we will just check if it is equal to the clique number. We already said that for all graphs, the clique number is a lower bound on the chromatic number, the question was if these two are equivalent for visibility graphs. (If we really wanted to compute the chromatic number from scratch we would have to check for every k between 1 and n (number of vertices) if it is k-colorable and take the smallest value for which it is true. The values of k with which we would work at each step could be optimised with something close to a binary search.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Most efficient algorithms for finding and testing the chromatic number of a graph (note that <b>both</b> problems are NP-complete) do not always give exact results. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_coloring">greedy coloring algorithm</a> is very efficient and finds a coloring in O(n) but can give very bad results depending on the ordering of the vertices. In fact it is as difficult to find a bad ordering as it is to find a good ordering. It is thus a good algorithm to find colorings but not to find the best one. Another algorithm, this time for testing the k-colorability of a graph can be found here <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0012-365X(94)90402-2">https://doi.org/10.1016/0012-365X(94)90402-2</a>. But again it is a probablistic algorithm and is does not necessarily give the right answer. The way it works is that it randomly assigns a color to each vertex and then at each step it will choose a "wrong" vertex and it will change it's colour. Again this color change is randomized but with weights based on it's neighbors colours so there could be even more "wrong" vertices after a change.
      </p>
      <p>
        After some research I then decided to implement a brute force algorithm using backtracking. As the conjecture about whether the clique number and chromatic number are the same in the case of our visibility graphs, in the case it is true we should never go the full way and have maximum complexity on the algorithm, but it computing the chromatic number does take a lot of time and is much longer than computing the clique number. The algorithm simply assigns a color to a vertex and then goes to the next vertex tries to assign a color to it adn if no color is possible, we backtrack. The upperbound time complexity will be O(k<sup>n</sup>), but will be on average smaller than that.
