This is a website, just launch index.html from the website folder in a browser

If launched with firefox there should be no problem.
Most other browsers need a local server for the page to work otherwise
you are stuck in a loading screen when the p5.js does it's preload.
Here is how to make it work in that case :

(I used the chrome extension on google chrome which worked well)
